# Slide-ify-Your-Study

## Overview
This project automates the creation of PowerPoint presentations from research papers using Artificial Intelligence (AI). It extracts key sections, summarizes critical points, and presents them in a structured, visually appealing format. Additionally, it identifies and extracts ðŸ“Š **images and charts** from the research paper to include them in the slides. The tool also offers flexibility in presentation styles, allowing users to generate **formal** or **informal** presentations based on their needs. This is particularly beneficial for researchers, educators, and professionals who need to prepare presentations quickly and efficiently.

## Hackathon Contribution
This project originated as part of ** Mined Hackathon 2025** organized by **Nirma University**. During the 48-hour hackathon, our team collaborated to design and prototype this innovative solution for a challenge provided by **Cactus Communications**.

##  Features
- **Text Extraction**: Processes research papers in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **Content Summarization**: Summarizes abstracts, introductions, methodologies, results, and conclusions.
- **Image Extraction**: Identifies and extracts relevant images, charts, and figures from the research paper for visual enhancement.
- **Slide Generation**: Converts summarized content and extracted images into PowerPoint slides with proper formatting and structure.
- **Presentation Styles**: Supports generating **formal** presentations (e.g., for academic or professional use) and **informal** presentations (e.g., for casual discussions or internal reviews).
- **Customization Options**: Allows users to choose sections to include, adjust slide design, and edit content manually.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `PyPDF2` / `pdfplumber`: For PDF text extraction
  - `NLTK` / `spaCy`: For natural language processing
  - `transformers`: For summarization models
  -  `python-pptx`: For creating PowerPoint slides
  - `opencv` / `Pillow`: For image extraction and processing
- **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained NLP models for text summarization and keyword extraction.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Upload a research paper in PDF format.
2. **Processing**:
   - Extract text and images from the document.
   - Identify key sections using NLP.
   - Summarize each section and extract key phrases.
3. **Output**: Generate a PowerPoint presentation with:
   - Title and introduction slides.
   - Slides for each major section (e.g., Methods, Results, Conclusion).
   - Visual elements (images, charts, or tables) extracted from the research paper.
   -  **Formal or Informal Style**: Users can choose between formal (structured and polished) or informal (more relaxed and conversational) slide designs.
4. ** Customization**: Users can modify generated slides before saving.

##  Challenges and Improvements
- **Challenges**:
  - Accurate extraction of relevant text from complex research paper layouts.
  - Ensuring that generated summaries capture the core ideas effectively.
  - Extracting high-quality images without artifacts.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Enhance summarization with domain-specific training.
  - Improve the design of generated slides for better aesthetics.
